abstract: "The exponential growth of the urban data generated by urban sensors,
  government reports, and crowd-sourcing services endorses the rapid development
  of urban computing and spatial data mining technologies. Easier accessibility
  to such enormous urban data may be a double-bladed sword. On the one hand,
  urban data can be applied to solve a wide range of practical issues such as
  urban safety analysis and urban event detection. On the other hand, ethical
  issues such as biasedly polluted urban data, problematic algorithms, and
  unprotected privacy may cause moral disaster not only for the research fields
  but also for the society. This paper seeks to identify ethical vulnerabilities
  from three primary research directions of urban computing: urban safety
  analysis, urban transportation analysis, and social media analysis for urban
  events. Visions for future improvements in the perspective of ethics are
  addressed."
