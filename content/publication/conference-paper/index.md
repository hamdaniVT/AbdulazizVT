title: "Collect Ethically: Reduce Bias in Twitter Datasets"
abstract: The Twitter platform is appealing to researchers due to the ease of
  obtaining data and the ability to analyze and produce results rapidly.
  However, sampling Twitter data for research purposes needs to be regulated to
  produce unbiased results. In this paper, factors that lead to sampling bias
  are addressed, case studies that have been encountered are presented, and an
  approach is proposed to reduce sampling bias and flaws in datasets collected
  from Twitter. Then, experiments are conducted on two case studies, and a
  larger dataset is achieved by following the proposed guideline. The results
  indicate that using multiple Twitter application programming interfaces (APIs)
  for data collection is the best way to obtain a randomly sampled dataset.
