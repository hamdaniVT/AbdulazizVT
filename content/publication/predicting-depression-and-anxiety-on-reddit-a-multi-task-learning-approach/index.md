abstract: One of the strongest indicators of a mental health crisis is how
  people interact with each other or express them-selves. Hence, social media is
  an ideal source to extract user-level information about the language used to
  express personal feelings. In the wake of the ever-increasing mental health
  crisis in the United States, it is imperative to analyze the general
  well-being of a population and investigate how their public social media posts
  can be used to detect different underlying mental health conditions. For that
  purpose, we propose a study that collects posts from “reddits” related to
  different mental health topics to detect the type of the post and the nature
  of the mental health issues that correlate to the post. The task of detecting
  mental health related issues indicates the mental health conditions connected
  to the posts. To achieve this, we develop a multi-task learning model that
  leverages, for each post, both the latent embedding space of words and topics
  for prediction with a message passing mechanism enabling the sharing of
  information for related tasks. We train the model through an active learning
  approach in order to tackle the lack of standardized fine-grained label data
  for this specific task.
