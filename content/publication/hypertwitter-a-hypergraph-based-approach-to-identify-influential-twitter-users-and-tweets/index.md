abstract: "Social media platforms have become an easy method of communication
  for many users. Content posted on social media can influence those who are
  exposed to it, and users who posted that content are referred to as
  influencers. Identifying influencers has many applications in marketing,
  politics, and even health awareness. While research identifying influential
  users across multiple fields has been studied extensively, usersâ€™ influence
  varies in different topics. Recent studies in topic-specific influence have
  shown that identifying influencers on the topic-level is more effective.
  However, most of the existing influencer detection approaches focus only on
  influential user identification and do not consider that some content can be
  influential regardless of who published it. This paper investigates the
  problem of detecting topic-specific influential users and tweets in Twitter
  datasets. We introduce HyperTwitter, a framework that uses a Twitter sub-graph
  consisting of users, tweets, and interactions as input. HyperTwitter generates
  a hypergraph with hyperedges of two types: networks and topic edges, then
  measures the topic distribution for both users and tweets. With this
  distribution and the constructed hypergraph, we create a local, topic-based
  influence ranking for each user and tweet. We conduct extensive experiments
  with two Twitter datasets and show that the proposed framework outperforms
  existing baselines significantly."
