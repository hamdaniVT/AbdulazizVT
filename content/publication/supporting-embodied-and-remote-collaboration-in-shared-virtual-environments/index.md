abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a tremendous impact on businesses,
  educational institutions, and other organizations that require in-person
  gatherings. Physical gatherings such as conferences, classes, and other social
  activities have been greatly reduced in favor of virtual meetings on Zoom,
  Webex or similar video-conferencing platforms. However, video-conferencing is
  quite limited in its ability to create meeting spaces that capture the
  authentic feel of a real-world meeting. Without the aid of body language cues,
  meeting participants have a harder time paying attention and keeping
  themselves engaged in virtual meetings. Video-conferencing, as it currently
  stands, falls short of providing a familiar environment that fosters personal
  connection between meeting participants. This paper explores an alternative
  approach to virtual meetings through the use of extended reality (XR) and
  embodied interactions. We present an application that leverages the full-body
  tracking capabilities of the Azure Kinect and the immersive affordances of XR
  to create more vibrant and engaging remote meeting environments.
