abstract: Text summarization has been intensively studied in many languages, and
  some languages have reached advanced stages. Yet, Arabic Text Summarization
  (ATS) is still in its developing stages. Existing ATS datasets are either
  small or lack diversity. We build, LANS, a large-scale and diverse dataset for
  Arabic Text Summarization task. LANS offers 8.4 million articles and their
  summaries extracted from newspapers websites metadata between 1999 and 2019.
  The high-quality and diverse summaries are written by journalists from 22
  major Arab newspapers, and include an eclectic mix of at least more than 7
  topics from each source. We conduct an intrinsic evaluation on LANS by both
  automatic and human evaluations. Human evaluation of 1000 random samples
  reports 95.4% accuracy for our collected summaries, and automatic evaluation
  quantifies the diversity and abstractness of the summaries. The dataset is
  publicly available upon request.
