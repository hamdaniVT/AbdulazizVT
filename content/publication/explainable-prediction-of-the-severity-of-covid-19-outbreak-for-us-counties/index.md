abstract: Ever since the COVID-19 outbreak, various works have focused on using
  multitude of different static and dynamic features to aid the prediction of
  disease forecasting models. However, in the absence of historical pandemic
  data these models will not be able to give any meaningful insight about the
  areas which are most likely to be affected based on preexisting conditions.
  Furthermore, the black box nature of neural networks often becomes an
  impediment for the concerned authorities to derive any meaning from. In this
  paper, we propose a novel explainable Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework
  called Graph-COVID-19-Explainer (GC-Explainer) that gives explainable
  prediction for the severity of the spread during initial outbreak. We utilize
  a comprehensive set of static population characteristics to use as node
  features of Graph where each node corresponds to a geographical region. Unlike
  post-hoc methods of GNN explanations, we propose a framework for learning
  important features during the training of the model. We further apply our
  model on real-world early pandemic data to show the validity of our approach.
  Through GC-Explainer, we show that static features along with spatial
  dependency among regions can be used to explain the varied degree of severity
  in outbreak during the early part of the pandemic and provide a framework to
  identify the at-risk areas for any infectious disease outbreak, especially
  when historical data is not available.
