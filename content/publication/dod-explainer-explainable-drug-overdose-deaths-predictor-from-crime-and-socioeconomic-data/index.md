abstract: Drug overdose deaths are a dreadful crisis that leads to substantial
  societal impairments. Its harmful impact directly affects families and
  communities. To assist policymakers in mitigating this crisis, it is crucial
  to study the societal, economic, and criminal contributing factors linked to
  the crisis. Unfortunately, current data-driven works assume a singular factor,
  such as poverty being the cause and disregarding other realistic causes.
  Besides, recent works exhibited a lack of explainable models and spatial
  analysis of the crisis. Thus, DOD-Explainer links the gap by developing a
  realistic framework that predicts highly impacted counties of drug overdose
  deaths from crime and socioeconomic data. DOD-Explainer overcomes the
  challenge of data scarcity by proposing three data augmentation methods. Then,
  an algorithm is proposed to provide realistic explanations of the leading
  causes of the crisis. The results show that our application achieves the best
  predictive accuracy from several models, accurately identifies the most/least
  impacted counties by the crisis, and reveals the most contributing factors of
  drug overdoses.
