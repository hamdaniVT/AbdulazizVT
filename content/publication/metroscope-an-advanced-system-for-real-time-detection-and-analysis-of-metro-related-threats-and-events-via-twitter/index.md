abstract: Metro systems are vital to our daily lives, but they face safety or
  reliability challenges, such as criminal activities or infrastructure
  disruptions, respectively. Real-time threat detection and analysis are crucial
  to ensure their safety and reliability. Although many existing systems use
  Twitter to detect metro-related threats or events in real-time, they have
  limitations in event analysis and system maintenance. Specifically, they
  cannot analyze event development, or prioritize events from numerous tweets.
  Besides, their users are required to continuously monitor system
  notifications, use inefficient content retrieval methods, and perform detailed
  system maintenance. We addressed those issues by developing the MetroScope
  system, a real-time threat/event detection system applied to Washington D.C.
  metro system. MetroScope can automatically analyze event development,
  prioritize events based on urgency, send emergency notifications via emails,
  provide efficient content retrieval, and self-maintain the system. Our
  MetroScope system is now available at http://orion.nvc.cs.vt.edu:5000/, with a
  video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKIK9M60-J8) introducing its features
  and instructions. MetroScope is a significant advancement in enhancing the
  safety and reliability of metro systems.
