abstract: Existing COVID-19 prediction models focus on studying the dynamic
  nature of the virus spread by using pandemic-related temporal data. In this
  paper, we present a work that exclusively uses comprehensive socioeconomic
  factors to predict the high risk areas of COVID-19 infection based on
  fine-grained static spatial analysis. Moreover, the most and least influential
  socioeconomic factors on COVID-19 spread are identified. This paper uses a
  uniquely built dataset by combining local statesâ€™ cumulative COVID-19
  statistics and their associated socioeconomic features on the zip code level.
  Further, the work solves the lack of data by augmentation. To evaluate the
  work, four case studies are conducted on Florida, Illinois, Minnesota, and
  Virginia. Experimental results show that the study provides accurate
  predictions with respect to ground truth data. By identifying high risk areas
  and socioeconomic factors, policymakers can use this study to take necessary
  measures to help disadvantaged communities.
