abstract: The drug abuse epidemic has been on the rise in the past few years,
  particularly after the start of COVID-19 pandemic. Our preliminary
  observations on Reddit alone show that discussions on drugs from 2018 to 2020
  increased between a range of 45% to 200%, and so has the number of unique
  users participating in those discussions. Existing efforts focused on
  utilizing social media to distinguish potential drug abuse chats from
  unharmful chats regardless of what drug is being abused. Others focused on
  understanding the trends and causes of drug abuse from social media. To this
  end, we introduce PRISTINE (opioid crisis detection on reddit), our work
  dynamically detects-and extracts evolving misleading drug names from Reddit
  comments using reinforced Dynamic Query Expansion (DQE) and constructs a
  textual Graph Convolutional Network with the aid of powerful pre-trained
  embeddings to detect which type of drug class a Reddit comment corresponds to.
  Further, we perform extensive experiments to investigate the effectiveness of
  our model.
