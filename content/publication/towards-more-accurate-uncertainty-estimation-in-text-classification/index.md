abstract: The uncertainty measurement of classified results is especially
  important in areas requiring limited human resources for higher accuracy. For
  instance, data-driven algorithms diagnosing diseases need accurate uncertainty
  score to decide whether additional but limited quantity of experts are needed
  for rectification. However, few uncertainty models focus on improving the
  performance of text classification where human resources are involved. To
  achieve this, we aim at generating accurate uncertainty score by improving the
  confidence of winning scores. Thus, a model called MSD, which includes three
  independent components as “mix-up”,“self-ensembling”,“distinctiveness score”,
  is proposed to improve the accuracy of uncertainty score by reducing the
  effect of overconfidence of winning score and considering the impact of
  different categories of uncertainty simultaneously. MSD can be applied with
  different Deep Neural Networks. Extensive experiments with ablation setting
  are conducted on four real-world datasets, on which, competitive results are
  obtained.
